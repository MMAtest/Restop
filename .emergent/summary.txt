The trajectory details the transformation of the ResTop restaurant stock management application from an MVP to a feature-rich Version 3. Initially, the AI engineer established core CRUD, Excel, OCR, and recipe functionalities, followed by an extensive UI redesign to the Alderobase graphic charter. The recent work involved implementing six major Version 3 features: enhanced data models with RBAC, Analytics & Profitability, Enhanced OCR Parsing (including PDF support), Advanced Stock Management, User Management Interface, Professional Data Grids, and Purchase Order Workflow. Throughout this, the AI meticulously addressed user feedback, correcting UI elements, refining OCR parsing logic, and ensuring data integrity. The current focus is on a user-requested side-by-side document and extracted data preview for the OCR module, actively troubleshooting its frontend integration and display.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive restaurant stock management solution, solving manual inventory and inefficient data entry. Key existing features include CRUD for products/suppliers, a React UI, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, recipe management, Tesseract OCR for Z reports/invoices, POS integration, backoffice for technical sheets, and data access. The application recently received a major overhaul to Version 3, introducing:
1.  **Core Data Model Evolution:** Product , , ;  linking model; price anomaly alerts;  for granular stock with , , ; and  vs.  logic for sales.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Super Admin (User Management), Gérant (Analytics default), Chef de cuisine (Stock/Production/Orders), Barman (Bar stock), Caissier (OCR).
3.  **Feature Modules:**
    *   **Enhanced OCR:** , , categorized items (, ),  from Z reports, automatic stock deduction, and PDF support.
    *   **Advanced Stock Management:** Manual adjustment (ingredient/dish), batch tracking, logging.
    *   **New Purchase Order Workflow:** Supplier selection,  pricing, item addition.
    *   **Analytics & Profitability:** Default for Gérant, profitability/recipe, sales analysis, alert center.
4.  **UI/UX:** Professional data grids with sorting/filtering. Recent focus on correcting UI issues in the Analytics dashboard and OCR module.

<current_work>
The application has just completed a series of significant Version 3 feature implementations and bug fixes based on user feedback.
The most recent work focused on enhancing the OCR module:
1.  **PDF Support:** The backend () now robustly extracts text from PDF invoices and Z reports using  and usage: pdfplumber [-h] [--structure | --structure-text]
                  [--format {csv,json,text}] [--types TYPES [TYPES ...]]
                  [--include-attrs INCLUDE_ATTRS [INCLUDE_ATTRS ...]]
                  [--exclude-attrs EXCLUDE_ATTRS [EXCLUDE_ATTRS ...]]
                  [--laparams LAPARAMS] [--precision PRECISION]
                  [--pages PAGES [PAGES ...]] [--indent INDENT]
                  [infile]

positional arguments:
  infile

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --structure           Write the structure tree as JSON. All other arguments
                        except --pages, --laparams, and --indent will be
                        ignored
  --structure-text      Write the structure tree as JSON including text
                        contents. All other arguments except --pages,
                        --laparams, and --indent will be ignored
  --format {csv,json,text}
  --types TYPES [TYPES ...]
  --include-attrs INCLUDE_ATTRS [INCLUDE_ATTRS ...]
                        Include *only* these object attributes in output.
  --exclude-attrs EXCLUDE_ATTRS [EXCLUDE_ATTRS ...]
                        Exclude these object attributes from output.
  --laparams LAPARAMS
  --precision PRECISION
  --pages PAGES [PAGES ...]
  --indent INDENT       Indent level for JSON pretty-printing.. The  model includes . The frontend () accepts PDF uploads and provides an icon-based preview.
2.  **OCR Parsing Fixes:** Specific bugs in  processing were resolved. The  extraction regex was fixed, categorization logic for items like Supions en persillade was corrected, and the  assignment was ensured. All these fixes were confirmed with 100% success.
3.  **OCR Preview Modal:** An interface to display the uploaded document side-by-side with its extracted, categorized data has been implemented in . This modal shows general info, items by category, a complete item list, and raw extracted text. The pop-up automatically closes after processing.

The *immediate* current state is that the AI has confirmed the backend OCR fixes and the implementation of the preview modal. However, the screenshot tool indicates that the Aperçu button in the OCR history on the frontend is not yet visually confirmed to be present and functional to open this new modal. The AI is awaiting user confirmation on whether to test the full frontend OCR preview or proceed.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the visibility and functionality of the Aperçu button in the OCR history to open the document preview modal.
