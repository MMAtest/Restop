The AI engineer successfully transformed the ResTop application from an MVP to Version 3, integrating critical features like enhanced data models with RBAC, Analytics, Advanced Stock, User Management, Professional Data Grids, and Purchase Orders. The trajectory details a deep dive into the OCR module, addressing user-reported bugs and feature requests. Initially, the focus was on implementing a side-by-side OCR document preview modal, which led to a bug report about incomplete raw text extraction. The AI then enhanced backend PDF parsing with multi-pass and image fallback. A subsequent bug involved missing unit and total prices, leading to further backend OCR parsing improvements and recipe-based price enrichment. The user then requested the preview modal to be accessible via the Corriger button and fixed an issue where CA Total and Plats Vendus were not displaying correctly on the main OCR page. The most significant recent development is the implementation of a detailed Z-report analysis feature, which shifted from a frontend-only plan to a robust backend-driven calculation based on user feedback, now integrated into a new Analyse tab within the OCR preview modal.

The overarching goal is to deliver a comprehensive restaurant stock management solution, reducing manual inventory and data entry. Key existing features include CRUD operations, recipe management, Tesseract OCR for reports, and a full-stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) architecture. Version 3 introduced:
1.  **Core Data Model Evolution**:  enhancements (reference price, main/secondary suppliers), , price anomaly alerts,  for granular stock, and  vs.  logic.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defined roles (Super Admin, Gérant, Chef de cuisine, Barman, Caissier) with specific permissions.
3.  **Feature Modules**:
    *   **Enhanced OCR**: Extraction of , , categorized items (, ),  from Z reports, automatic stock deduction, and PDF support. This was later expanded to include full raw text extraction, unit/total price extraction, and comprehensive Z-report analysis.
    *   **Advanced Stock Management**: Manual adjustments, batch tracking, logging.
    *   **New Purchase Order Workflow**: Supplier selection, pricing integration, item addition.
    *   **Analytics & Profitability**: Gérant default dashboard, profitability by recipe, sales analysis, alert center.
4.  **UI/UX**: Professional data grids with sorting/filtering. Recent explicit requests for OCR focused on:
    *   A side-by-side document and extracted data preview modal (implemented).
    *   Fixing incomplete raw text extraction from PDFs (implemented).
    *   Fixing unit and total price extraction in OCR (implemented).
    *   Making the preview modal accessible from the Corriger button in the OCR module (implemented).
    *   Correctly displaying CA Total and Plats vendus on the main OCR page (implemented).
    *   Implementing detailed Z-report analysis, reorganizing categories into BAR, ENTRÉES, PLATS PRINCIPAUX, DESSERTS, calculating total items and CA per family, verifying against Total TTC, and displaying this analysis within a new modal tab (backend logic implemented, frontend display integrated).

<current_work>
The immediate focus before this summary was on enhancing the Z-report analysis within the OCR module and integrating its display into the frontend. The backend () has been thoroughly updated to perform comprehensive Z-report analysis:
-   Robust French number parsing ().
-   Intelligent extraction of category headers ().
-   Flexible mapping of categories into four main families (BAR, ENTRÉES, PLATS, DESSERTS) using regex, with unrecognized categories grouped under Autres.
-   Extraction of global report information like Nombre de couverts and Total TTC.
-   A new  field is populated within the  object, containing detailed counts of articles and CA per family, along with a critical  block (comparing calculated total with , and showing any delta). This analysis is computed upon Z-report upload and also on-the-fly for existing documents when accessed.

On the frontend (), a new Analyse tab has been successfully added to the OCR preview modal. This tab is responsible for displaying the structured  data received from the backend, including:
-   Main data: Date, Number of covers, Displayed Total Sales (TTC).
-   Breakdown by family: Articles sold, Turnover (CA), and details of source sub-categories.
-   A Verification block: Calculated total vs. displayed total, variance in € and %, and status (Coherent / To be verified).

The frontend also previously fixed the display of CA Total and Plats vendus on the main OCR page, ensuring they now correctly reflect  and the sum of  from , and the Corriger button now opens the preview modal directly to the Document + Données tab.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to confirm the functionality and accuracy of the new Analyse tab in the OCR preview modal with the user.
